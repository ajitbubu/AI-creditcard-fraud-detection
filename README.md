# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Explainable AI (XAI)

A comprehensive fraud detection system that combines supervised machine learning with anomaly detection, enhanced with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability and explainable AI capabilities.

## üöÄ Features

- **Hybrid Detection Model**: Combines XGBoost/Random Forest with Isolation Forest for enhanced fraud detection
- **Explainable AI**: SHAP integration for both global and local model explanations
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Streamlit-based dashboard for model training, evaluation, and batch scoring
- **Flexible Model Selection**: Automatic fallback from XGBoost to Random Forest if XGBoost is unavailable
- **Batch Scoring**: Score new transactions with detailed explanations
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, confusion matrices, and precision-recall curves

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt                # Python dependencies

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the files)

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note**: If XGBoost installation fails, the system will automatically fall back to Random Forest.

3. **Prepare your data**:
   - Ensure your dataset has a `Class` column (1 = fraud, 0 = legitimate)
   - The system works best with the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset
   - Sample data is provided in `data-source/creditcard_sample.csv`

## üöÄ Usage

### Web Interface (Recommended)

Launch the interactive Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The web interface provides:
- **Data Upload**: Upload your credit card dataset
- **Model Configuration**: Adjust weights, thresholds, and contamination rates
- **Real-time Training**: Train models with your data
- **Interactive Visualizations**: SHAP plots, confusion matrices, PR curves
- **Batch Scoring**: Score new transactions with explanations
- **Downloadable Results**: Export scored data with fraud predictions and reasons

### Command Line Interface

Run the standalone script for batch processing:

```bash
# Set the path to your dataset (optional, defaults to creditcard.csv)
export CREDITCARD_CSV="data-source/creditcard.csv"

# Run the fraud detection script
python fraud_shap_xai.py
```

This will:
- Train the hybrid fraud detection model
- Generate SHAP visualizations (saved as PNG files)
- Create local explanations for top suspicious transactions
- Output performance metrics

## üìä Model Architecture

### Hybrid Approach
The system combines two complementary approaches:

1. **Supervised Learning** (XGBoost/Random Forest)
   - Learns from labeled fraud examples
   - Optimized for class imbalance with appropriate weights
   - Provides probability scores for known fraud patterns

2. **Anomaly Detection** (Isolation Forest)
   - Detects novel, unseen fraud patterns
   - Identifies outliers in transaction behavior
   - Complements supervised learning for zero-day fraud

### Scoring Formula
```
Hybrid Score = w_sup √ó Supervised_Probability + w_anom √ó Scaled_Anomaly_Score
```

Where weights can be adjusted based on your fraud detection strategy.

## üîç Explainable AI Features

### Global Explanations
- **Feature Importance**: Which features matter most for fraud detection
- **SHAP Summary Plots**: How each feature contributes across all predictions
- **Beeswarm Plots**: Distribution of feature impacts

### Local Explanations
- **Waterfall Plots**: Step-by-step explanation for individual predictions
- **Force Plots**: Visual breakdown of prediction reasoning
- **Feature Contributions**: Quantified impact of each feature on specific decisions

## üìà Performance Metrics

The system provides comprehensive evaluation metrics:

- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
- **PR-AUC**: Area under the Precision-Recall curve (important for imbalanced data)
- **Confusion Matrix**: True/False positives and negatives at chosen threshold
- **Precision-Recall Curves**: Compare supervised vs. hybrid model performance

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Model Parameters
- **Test Size**: Proportion of data used for testing (default: 20%)
- **Random Seed**: For reproducible results
- **Contamination Rate**: Expected fraud rate for anomaly detection (default: 0.5%)

### Hybrid Model Weights
- **Supervised Weight**: Emphasis on learned patterns (default: 0.7)
- **Anomaly Weight**: Emphasis on outlier detection (default: 0.3)
- **Decision Threshold**: Cutoff for fraud classification (default: 0.9)

## üìã Data Requirements

Your dataset should:
- Contain a `Class` column with binary labels (1 = fraud, 0 = legitimate)
- Have numeric features (non-numeric columns are auto-encoded)
- Be reasonably balanced or the system will handle imbalance automatically
- Follow the structure of the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset

## üîß Troubleshooting

### XGBoost Installation Issues
If XGBoost fails to install:
1. The system automatically falls back to Random Forest
2. Remove `xgboost` from `requirements.txt` if needed
3. Performance will be similar with Random Forest

### Memory Issues
For large datasets:
1. Reduce the background sample size in SHAP calculations
2. Use the `max_display` parameter to limit visualization complexity
3. Process data in smaller batches

### Performance Optimization
- Use the contamination parameter to match your expected fraud rate
- Adjust hybrid weights based on your fraud detection priorities
- Tune the decision threshold based on your precision/recall requirements

## üèÉ Run Instructions

```bash
# Create & activate env
